## siso.m
Generate a swquence of data bits and modulate the bits into BPSK. Simulate the reception over the channel with AWGN. Calculate SNR and BER afer receving all the datas.  
The accuracy of prediction will decrease as distance increase.

## modulation.m
Generate a swquence of data bits and modulate the bits into three kinds of modulatoin - BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM. Simulate the reception over the channel with AWGN. Calculate SNR and BER afer receving all the datas.  
SNRs and BERs of different modulation methods are shown in the figure below. Also, the accuracy decreases as distance increase.
